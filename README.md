# WAG Finance

WAGFI is a dollar auction. There's an initial prize of money that participants can place bids to win. The next bid must be higher than the previous one. The highest bidder wins, but the second highest bidder always loses their bid as well. All bidders receive WAG tokens which can be used to stake. They are then able to receive staking rewards, which are generated from the losers' bids. A second random loser is also chosen. Their bid is also added to the staking rewards pool.
